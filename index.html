	<h1>Welcome to my site.<br>Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
    	<p>
		I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.
		 But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.<br><br>
		If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films.
		 And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
